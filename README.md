# AI Video Classification with ResNet3D-18

🎥🤖 **Diving into AI and Video Classification!**

I’ve been working on a cool project using **ResNet3D-18**, a deep learning model that can analyze videos and classify them based on the activities happening inside. From cycling through snow to playing soccer, this model can detect it all!

## Highlights of the project:
1. **Pretrained Power**: Leveraging ResNet3D-18, which is pretrained on large datasets, to get better results and faster predictions.
2. **Smooth Preprocessing**: Ensuring the video data is well-prepared for the model – resizing, normalizing, and all that good stuff.
3. **Fast Predictions**: With a few lines of code, I can predict activities in real-time from any video. (Who knew baking cookies was so high-tech? 🍪)

## 🎯 Takeaways:
- The crucial role of data preprocessing in machine learning.
- How 3D convolutional networks are a game-changer for understanding time-based data like videos.

This has been an awesome learning experience, and I’m excited to see how I can apply this to other projects – from sports analysis to video surveillance.
